# ISEMS assets

This repository contains design assets used on the isems website and in presentations.

The icons used in the designs come from the noun project and are used as licensed by @k-nut.

For all icons, creative-commons versions exist so that the derived drawings could be shared freely
if the original icon creators are properly attributed.
